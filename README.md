- Definitions for PCD.

## TODO

- Integrating ECC EDK2 tool for checking coding guidelines of the code.
- References, Hover and Auto-completion for metafile data.

## Contribution

This project is kind of a new thing to me. You will see my code in tatters with respect to design principles in TS. Please feel free to contribute to the code. Do a fork, create branches with the name `<username>/<branch_name>` and raise PR. I will make sure to look at it. Thanks in advance for your help.
**Enjoy!**
